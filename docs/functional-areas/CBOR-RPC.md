## Abstract

Crazyradio 2.0 uses a generic Remote Procedure Call protocol on top of the [CBOR] serializing format.
This protocol is the only way to interact with Crazyradio 2.0 over [usb](usb-protocol.md) or possibly over other
transport in the future.

This protocol is greatly inspired by [MessagePack-RPC] but using CBOR instead of MessagePack as serialization format.

## Protocol flow

The protocol defines 3 messages types:
 - Request
 - Response
 - Notification

Request and responses are used for procedure call. They both contains a message ID that allows to match a response with
the corresponding response. Notifications are sent and received without any message ID, they are identified by a
method name.

Typically a RPC server will receive requests and send back response. A client will send requests and receive response.
Both client and server can send and receive notifications.

## Messages format

All messages are encoded and sent on the wire as a CBOR array.

Methods name and errors starting with ".well-known" are reserved for the protocol itself and should not be used.

### Request message

    [Type (0), msgid, method, params]

 - **type**: Unsigned integer of value 0 to denote a request
 - **msgid**: Unsigned integer of up to 64Bits precision. The *Response* message from the server will have the same *msgid*.
 - **method**: String representing or index the method to call
 - **params**: Any CBOR element

### Response message

    [Type (1), msgid, error, result]

 - **type**: Unsigned integer of value 1 to denote a response
 - **msgid**: Unsigned integer of up to 64Bits precision. This has the same value as in the *Request* message that initiated this response.
 - **error**: *Null* if there is no error. Any CBOR element otherwise.
 - **result**: Any CBOR element

### Notification message

    [Type (2), method, param]

 - **type**: Unsigned integer of value 0 to denote a request
 - **method**: String or index representing the method that initiated or will receive the notification.
 - **params**: Any CBOR element

## Method not found error

If a method is not found, the server answer with:

    [type (1), msgid, "well-known.NotFound", Null]

This is a special case to indicate that the method does not exists.

## Listing methods

A special method exists to list the supported methods of a server:

    [type (0), msgid, "well-known.methods, None]

The response result contains a CBOR Map with as key string of the method name and as value an unsigned integer that can be
used as method index.

## Method name compression

Since the intention of the protocol is to be used in a context where the list of method is static, methods can be called
by index instead of by name. This improves a lot the efficiently since it can instantly select the method on the server
side instead of using a look-up table.

The [method listing procedure](#listing-methods) returns the list of all the methods associated with there index, the
index can then be used instead of the method name in Request and Notifications.
